[Visit Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nice-speed-dials/igdancpfkcmgelecddchfeijbofdcnaa)

Nice Speed Dials is a Chrome extension With a sleek and intuitive interface that
allows you to organize your browser's new tab page with your favourite websites
and links. With just a few clicks, you can create and organize a collection of
speed dials that can be accessed from any new tab you open.

Unlike other speed dial extensions or the default new tab page, Nice Speed Dials
stores your speed dials as bookmarks in your Chrome account. This means that
even if you change devices or uninstall the extension, your speed dials will
remain safe and accessible. Simply log in to your Chrome account on any device,
and your speed dials will be there waiting for you.

IMPORTANT: Please remember that your speed dials are not stored on our server,
but in your own Chrome account's bookmarks. So please do not delete the bookmark
folder "NICE_SPEED_DIALS_BOOKMARKS\_[DO_NOT_DELETE]", as this is where your
speed dials are stored. If you delete this folder, you will lose your speed
dials. or any update in that folder will be reflected in your new tab speed
dials. However, you can use this to your advantage by saving any bookmark to
this folder, and it will appear on your new tab speed dials!
